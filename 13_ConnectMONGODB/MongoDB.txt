          SQL
SQL Databases are built in a relational  structure.
Related tables  reference each other with joins as data is queried. (Le tabelle correlate fanno riferimento l'una all'altra con i join quando i dati vengono interrogati.)
Relational tables also normalize the data, that means data is not duplicated in the tables. D.R.Y (Don't Repeat Yourself)

          MONGODB (NOSQL)
MongoDB stores data in collections, the individuals records in the collections are called documents.
The documents have a key-value structure and look a lot like json.
A collection holds all of the data about user, for example, instead of breaking it into related tables.
Duplicating and distibuting data is permitted
